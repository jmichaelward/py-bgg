<div>
    <p>For now, the only way to create a user's collection is to send a POST request to
    /api/v1/users/(username)/collection, where "username" is the BoardGameGeek username of
    the user whose collection you'd like to download.</p>

    <p><strong>Updated:</strong> user collections will now be automatically downloaded when a new user is
    added on the add-user page. BoardGameGeek returns a 202 message the first time a request for a user's collection
    is made, so it may not be immediately visible on the first page load. If it isn't, attempt a refresh a short
    while later, and you should expect to see it.</p>

    <p>Once you have created that user, you can attempt to view their profile at "/users/(username)" (or check the users
        table in the database) to confirm that it worked! The user's profile page should list the full set of games
        listed in the user's profile on BoardGameGeek.com.</p>

    <p>This, of course, will change with time. More to come!</p>
