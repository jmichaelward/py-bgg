    <p>Here are some web views:</p>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/add-user">Add user to the database</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

</div>
<nav>
    <p>And here are some API endpoints you can check out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/api/v1/users">Users</a></li>
        <li><a href="/api/v1/games">Games</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

<div>
    <p>For now, the only way to create a user's collection is to send a POST request to
    /api/v1/users/collection, with a key of "username" and a value of the BoardGameGeek username of
    the user whose collection you'd like to download.</p>

    <p>Once you have created that user, you can attempt to view their profile at "/users/(username)" (or check the users
        table in the database) to confirm that it worked! The user's profile page should list the full set of games
        listed in the user's profile on BoardGameGeek.com.</p>

    <p>This, of course, will change with time. More to come!</p>
