I <3 Python.

This project is exploratory only. It's purpose is to:

1. Help reacquaint myself with database schema design.
2. Learn how Python interacts with the database layer.
3. See how to handle routing and form submissions in Flask.

The code in this project is neither production ready, nor
anything I'm proud of or intend to show off. Rather, I'm keeping
it in a public repository here so I can demonstrate my dedication
to learning and practicing core programming concepts, and 
also so I have a version-controlled place where I can pick up
where I left off should I switch between development environments.
